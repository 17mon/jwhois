Changes in jwhois 2.1

 * Default configuration file location changed from DATADIR to SYSCONFDIR
   (normally /usr/local/etc/ or /etc/). jwhois will still search in DATADIR
   if it can't find a configuration file for backwards compatibility.
 * Added more information to the texinfo manual about RIPE extensions to
   the WHOIS protocol.
 * Added RIPE/APNIC and ARIN handles to the example configuration file.
 * Added support for specifying port numbers, both on command line and
   in configuration file.

Changes in jwhois 2.0

 * jwhois-server is dropped from the package and will later be replaced
   by jwhoisd which will be bundled separately.
 * jwhois is now written in C code.
 * configuration file format has changed.
