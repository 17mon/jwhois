@chapter Introduction

@sc{jwhois} is an Internet Whois client that queries hosts for information
according to RFC 954 - NICNAME/WHOIS. @sc{jwhois} can be configured to
decide via regular expressions which servers to query for information, based
on the information that the user wishes to retrieve.

@node Invocation, Site Configuration, Introduction, Top
@chapter Invocation

@sc{jwhois} uses the following command-line options:
@table @samp

@item --version
Print the version information for this program, then exit.

@item --help
Print a usage message summarizing the command-line options, then exit.

@item -c FILE
@item --config=FILE
Reads configuration from FILE instead of the default.

@item -h HOST
@item --host=HOST
Overrides any specifications in the configuration file and queries HOST
directly.

@item -p PORT
@item --port=PORT
Specifies a port number to use when querying a HOST

@end table

@chapter RIPE Extensions

RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) has defined a number of options that can be
used against a RIPE-compatible whois server (ripe.net, apnic.net and
others).  Unfortunately, there is really no way of telling whether a
host we are connecting to is RIPE-compatible or not.  RIPE extensions
are therefor not directly incorporated into the @sc{jwhois} client.
A list of the options can be found in RIPE Document 157 which you can get
from the RIPE ftp server, @url{ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/docs/}.

It is possible to use these options together with @sc{jwhois} by changing
the format of the query slightly. If you were to search for all entries in
the RIPE database which lists the admin-c, tech-c or zone-c as CO19-RIPE,
you could use the following command syntax:

@example
$ jwhois -h whois.ripe.net -- "-i admin-c,tech-c,zone-c CO19-RIPE"
@end example

@samp{--} is used to separate the RIPE options from the jwhois options.

@chapter Site Configuration

@sc{jwhois} is configurable via its @file{jwhois.conf} file. This file
is looked for in the sysconfdir that was specified when compiling the
program (default is @file{/usr/local/etc}). If this file can not be
found, it will look for it in datadir (default is @file{/usr/local/share}).
If no configuration file can be found, @sc{jwhois} will default all queries
to @url{whois.internic.net}.

An example configuration file that includes most known Whois servers can be
found in the @code{example} subdirectory of the official distribution.

In the @samp{whois-servers} block, the configuration file matches
regular expressions to a Whois server name. When reading this list
of hosts, jwhois starts at the bottom and works its way up, querying
the last host that matched the regular expression.

Here is an example of such a block:

@example
whois-servers @{
        ".*\.se$" = "whois.nic-se.se";
        ".*" = "whois.internic.net";
@};
@end example

This would query the Whois server @samp{whois.nic-se.se} if the user were
to supply the query @samp{sunet.se}, or any other query that would match
the first specified regular expressions. All queries that could not be
matched against this regular expression would instead be matched against
the last expression, thus making the query go to the @samp{whois.internic.net}
Whois server.

The host name can be postfixed with @samp{:port} to specify an alternative
port number to use when querying that host.
