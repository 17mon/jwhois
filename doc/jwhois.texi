@chapter Introduction

@sc{jwhois} is an Internet Whois client that queries hosts for information
according to RFC 954 - NICNAME/WHOIS. @sc{jwhois} can be configured to
decide via regular expressions which servers to query for information, based
on the information that the user wishes to retrieve.

@chapter Invocation

@sc{jwhois} uses the following command-line options:
@table @samp

@item --version
Print the version information for this program, then exit.

@item --help
Print a usage message summarizing the command-line options, then exit.

@item -c FILE
@item --config=FILE
Reads configuration from FILE instead of the default.

@item -h HOST
@item --host=HOST
Overrides any specifications in the configuration file and queries HOST
directly.

@end table

@chapter Site Configuration

@sc{jwhois} is configurable via its @file{jwhois.conf} file. This file
is looked for in the datadir that was specified when compiling the
program (default is @file{/usr/local/share}). An example configuration file
that includes most known Whois servers can be found in the @code{example}
subdirectory of the official distribution.

In the @samp{whois-servers} block, the configuration file matches
regular expressions to a Whois server name. When reading this list
of hosts, jwhois starts at the bottom and works its way up, querying
the last host that matched the regular expression.

Here is an example of such a block:

@example
whois-servers @{
        ".*\.se$" = "whois.nic-se.se";
        ".*" = "whois.internic.net";
@};
@end example

This would query the Whois server @samp{whois.nic-se.se} if the user were
to supply the query @samp{sunet.se}, or any other query that would match
the first specified regular expressions. All queries that could not be
matched against this regular expression would instead be matched against
the last expression, thus making the query go to the @samp{whois.internic.net}
Whois server.
