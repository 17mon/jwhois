This is jwhois, an improved Whois client capable of selecting Whois server
to query based on a flexible configuration file using either regular
expressions or CIDR blocks.

Please send bug reports, suggestions, improvements, rewrites and other
material to jonas@coyote.org.

1. Configuration File
=====================

   In the example/ subdirectory in the distribution archive is an example
configuration file for jwhois. This file should contain all of the known
public Whois server records. Any changes to either host listed in that
example configuration file should be reported to the maintainer so that
the change can be included in future releases.

   The configuration file should reside in the /usr/local/etc directory,
or the directory that you specified using the --sysconfdir switch to the
configure script.

2. ./configure

2.1. Default Host
=================

   If jwhois can't find any configuration file, the queries will be
directed to a default host. The default value is `whois.internic.net',
but this can be changed by using the --enable-DEFAULTHOST switch to
the configure script.

2.2. Cache Functionality
========================

   This version of jwhois includes some experimental code for cache
functionality. It should be considered an early beta version. What it
does is that it creates a file in the filesystem (default location is
/var/lib/jwhois.db, but this can be configured by the --enable-CACHEFILE
directive to ./configure, or by a token in the configuration file) that
can be read and written to by a specific group. The jwhois client binary
is then setgid to that group so that all users can use the same cache.

   The default group is `nogroup' which is probably a sane enough
alternative that shouldn't impose any security problems. The group can
be set by calling the configure script with the `--enable-GROUP' parameter,
or you can modify the group owner and setgid bits manually.

   If the group that jwhois will run as can not write to the directory
where you tell it to create the database, you have to create the database
(touch <filename>) manually and change the group and security bits correctly.
Or you could also allow the group to write in the directory. Please consider
that you could be using a dbm which uses several files too, such as '.pag'
and '.dir' and you might have to set correct owner and mode on those too.

3. IPv6 Support
===============

   jwhois has support for IPv6 using the inet6-apps package from The
Inner Net.  The package is delivered with the libinet6.a library which
consists of a number of functions required for IPv6, such as improved
versions of getaddrinfo().  If your systems C library already has support
for IPv6 in getaddrinfo(), you don't need the inet6-apps package.

4. Obtaining JWHOIS
===================
JWHOIS can be obtained via anonymous FTP from
ftp://ftp.coyote.org/pub/jwhois/
